# surfs_up

## Overview:
The purpose of this analysis was to help the client figure out the temperature data and trend for the months of June and December. Filtering the data out for these months and calculating summary statistics helped the client decide whether it was opening up the surf and icecream shop was a sustainable business idea.

## Results:
1. There was more data available for June than December. The average temperature was higher in June (74) than in december (71) but only by a few degrees.
2. Temperatures fluctuate alot more in December than in June as the standard deviation is highher in december. 

## Summary
The results show that there isn't a hugh difference between the temperature conditions of June and December and means our client can have  all year round operations. However, before moving forward, I would like to gain a better understanding of the other key factors that could influence the surf shop, mainly precipitation figures (filter by the two months to compare the conditions) and number of stations (to gain a more accurate and reliable reading).
